      <p>That's me with my sons - I'm a Designer. I design software for your phone, your desktop, and the internet.</p>
      <h6>What am I doing now?</h6>
      <p>I'm at <a href="http://www.earnest.com">Earnest</a> in San Francisco where I am a Product Designer (who codes<small><sup>1</sup></small>). I'm always trying to use the tool that best fits the fidelity of the solution. Sometimes the right tool is Sketch, Photoshop, or Illustrator; sometimes the right tool is HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Ruby &mdash;; other times it is spreadsheet or a flowchart on a whiteboard. Learning and solving problems is what gets me excited.</p>
      <p>I love discussing just about anything related to design or code. Feel free to <a href="mailto:lucas@volan.co">ask me about it</a>.</p>
      <p><small><sup>1</sup>I have a <a href="http://compsci.cofc.edu/undergraduate-programs/computer-information-systems.php">degree in CS</a> and 12 years of professional experience as a designer.</small></p>
