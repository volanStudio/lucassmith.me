      <p>That's me with my sons - I'm a Designer. I design software for your phone, your desktop, and the internet.</p>
      <h6>What am I doing now?</h6>
      <p>I'm at <a href="http://www.earnest.com">Earnest</a> in San Francisco where I am a Product Designer. I get really excited about amplifying human abilities with computers &ndash; that drives me to create great experiences. I work on internal tools at Earnest and really enjoy delivering value to my coworkers. I'm always trying to use the fidelity that will best serve the project, that occasionally leads me to code<small><sup>1</sup></small>.</p>
      <p>I love discussing just about anything related to design, product, or code. Feel free to <a href="mailto:lucas@volan.co">ask me about it</a>.</p>
      <p><small><sup>1</sup>I have a <a href="http://compsci.cofc.edu/undergraduate-programs/computer-information-systems.php">degree in CS</a> and 12 years of professional experience as a designer.</small></p>
