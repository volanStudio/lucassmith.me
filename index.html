      <p>That's me trying to look cool. I'm a Designer; more specifically I design software for your phone, your desktop, and the internet.</p>
      <h6>What am I doing now?</h6>
      <p>I'm at <a href="http://www.weldai.com">Weld</a> where I <em>was</em> just the Designer but now I also handle iOS (&amp; front-end) Engineering<small><sup>1</sup></small> roles. There is a long story around the iOS Engineering stuff that involves a great <a href="https://github.com/ocrickard">Engineer</a> (and friend) and some <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/" alt="Treehouse is really great">very</a> <a href="https://executeios.com/" alt="Outdated and defunct, but Sam Soffes rules">late</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" alt="Sometimes you just have to google 'site:stackoverflow.com', am I right?">nights</a> &mdash; <a href="mailto:lucas@volan.co">ask me about it</a> sometime.</p>
      <p><small><sup>1</sup> Taking on some engineering was not completely foreign. I have a <a href="http://compsci.cofc.edu/undergraduate-programs/computer-information-systems.php">degree in CS</a> and a passion for design. I am grateful that the two have converged again.</small></p>
