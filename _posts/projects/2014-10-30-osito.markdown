short:      Osito was an app designed to simplify interactions with your phone. That is broad and pretty vague - ultimately, we were trying to push users information when they needed it. The idea is really more akin to a digital personal assistant.

Osito was an app designed to simplify interactions with your phone. That is broad and pretty vague - ultimately, we were trying to push users information when they needed it. The idea is really more akin to a digital personal assistant.

##How it began

I joined the team as Designer when the product was taking shape. The app had a rough UI and some branding under a different name. I was tasked with designing the app, the marketing site, and eventually, the new brand.

We were still adding “triggers” and actions. As we added the triggers, we started to uncover how much data the average person truly processes on their mobile device. Juggling emails, chats, receipts, weather, traffic, etc. becomes a large scale operation with just a small number of contact points.

##Initial Designs

Pretty early on, I started to drive the team toward a card-based interface *(fig. 1)* so that we could handle the design of each trigger in a more hierarchical way. This type of data imbues itself to a quick, at-a-glance interaction. Once you start putting disparate data into the mix, you get some long absorption times. We quickly decided to build a grid-based card system with standardized button / action placement.

This really started to come together over a few weeks in January/February of 2013. We were targeting an April release which made this visual overhaul a bit harrowing. As a result, I happened to jump in the iOS repo and start hacking away on the welcome flow. This was actually the first time I’d opened Xcode - it was a bit daunting, but really fun.

  <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

  <p>Making wide-reaching apps is hard. Who do you test with? What is the target user’s interest in an app like this? Where do we go when we only get general feedback?</p>

  <p>I think that building Osito taught the entire team about focus in the sphere of a product. We lacked it; we tried to design for very broad uses and it burned us. Once the app was released, we got some really great feedback that made us rethink the entirety of what we were building.</p>

  <h4>Half-way to a Pivot</h4>

  <p>We learned that users wanted control - without it they felt adrift in our system. Users had a hard time relying on Osito to get them the data they needed. Users wanted to know *what* was being tracked and that it *was* being tracked at a threshold they thought prudent.</p>

  <p>We developed a stop-gap solution that we called Look-Ahead <em>(fig. 2)</em>. Look-Ahead was essentially a dashboard that kept our users in the loop as to what was next on Osito’s radar. We tried to compartmentalize the triggers and help the user understand what information Osito was looking for.</p>

##Conclusion

Osito was an attempt to simplify interacting with your phone and became an act of reassuring the user that we were paying attention. Osito lacked the feedback loop that users crave. Bolting on a feedback loop ultimately didn’t work.

Eventually we did pivot toward our strongest trigger - email. That is a story for a different case study…

##Design Details

While I typically start with wireframes, this project warranted a different approach. Features were sketched on whiteboards and ocassionally some scrap paper. Those were then put through the photoshop wringer immediately. It made for some fast turnarounds, but process is a thing that you need to weigh when moving this fast.

##Website: Design/Build

I went looking for comps of the site and I can't find any; I think this was completely designed in the browser with the exception of the graphic assets. The site was featured on a few inspiration sites as an example of "well executed minimal design".

This was the first time I used Jekyll + SASS. Our iOS engineer was a big fan of the Jekyll. I had heard of SASS before, but the combo really is amazing. They are still a big part of my workflow for web projects.
