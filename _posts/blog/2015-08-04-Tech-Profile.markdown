## My tech profile

Things I use daily. This is inspired by IFTTT. We should all have a tech stack file that we can port for the impending Internet of things overwhelming.

When I want to use a new service I have to port 10K things and set new preferences. Why isn't there a transferable preference file I can share? Can we establish a standard? I'd like to try - this is my first attempt.
